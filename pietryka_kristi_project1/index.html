		<h2 id="definition">What is Photography?</h2>
		<p><strong>Photography</strong> is the science, art and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.</p>
			
		<h3 id="involved">What Exactly is Involved?</h3>
		<p>Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.</p>
		<p>Photography is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g. photolithography) and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, recreational purposes, and mass communication.</p>
			
		<h3 id="starting">What Do I Need to Get Started?</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>A camera, preferably an <abbr title="single lens reflex">SLR</abbr> or <abbr title="digital single lens reflex">DSLR</abbr></li>
			<li>A subject--photograph ANYTHING you want!</li>
			<li>A willingness to learn (cheesy, but true)</li>
